/*Before anything else, write the pseudocode of your steps and how you will solve this exercise.
Create a string for the user saying: You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:
Assign three variables. Each variable contains the corresponding result of calculation using a unique arithmetic operator (+-/*). Each must equal one of the three codes in the combination.
Add comments throughout the code to explain each step in the process.
Create a dialog box displaying the vault codes and the text if using HTML and a script tag, or create a popup dialog.
Please submit either a file with your code or a screenshot of the code, with the pseudocode showing.
I need to create one const and three var codes. I will put them together to create the full code leaving spaces or adding commas where needed.
Now, I need to create a list for the numbers in the combination.
After the list, I need to align everything so it looks neat.

const str4 = 'You have received this message because you have been chosen to open an important vault. Here is the secret combination:';
//Initial message complete
var code1 = 11+8;
var code2 = 40/4;
var code3 = 1*36;
//Three numbers based on familial ages
console.log(str4 + code1 + ',' + code2 + ',' + "and" + " " + code3);
//This is displaying  the code correctly
